### Definitions
- Thread: A thread is a simplified view of how a processor executes a sequential program in modern computers. A thread consists of the code of the program, the point in the code that is being executed, and the values of its variables and data structures. The execution of a thread is sequential as far as a user is concerned. One can use a source-level debugger to monitor the progress of a thread by executing one statement at a time, looking at the statement that will be executed next and checking the values of the variables and data structures as the execution progresses.

When a programâ€™s host code calls a kernel, the CUDA runtime system launches a grid of threads that are organized into a two-level hierarchy. Each grid is organized as an array of thread blocks, which we will refer to as blocks for brevity. All blocks of a grid are of the same size; each block can contain up to 1024 threads on current systems.
